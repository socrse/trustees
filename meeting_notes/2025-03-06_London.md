## Topics discussed

Visions and priorities for the next year

- Financial sustainability
  - We are reliant upon the annual conference for our funding
  - We should ensure that we can apply for grants, bearing in mind that our charitable status may be a blocker
  - Could explore sponsorship offers for the society and what our offering would be.
  - It's more work, but we could look at consultancy (e.g. recruitment panels, job descriptions)
- Membership offering
  - Should we think about tiered (e.g. individual, institutional and corporate)
  - Promote member benefits with clarity
- We should reboot the advisory board, and perhaps think about having an industry board
- Push more for policy change - e.g. promotion framework advocacy
- Efficiency
  - Can we recruit for help to manage administrative burden
  - Consolidation of our documentation, processess and project boards
- External review of our EDIA policies and procedures
  - W3C Accessibility Guidelines fairly straight forward
  - May get more value from a review of our policies, processes and documentation

Review of our activities across the society and how can we be more efficient with our time

- What must we do legally as a charity
- What is good for the society but not crucial
- What is required for the society to be viable
- What do all trustees do
- What can we delegate to specific trustees
- What can we delegate to members
- What can we stop doing

The trustees would like to pursue offers of administration support to enable us to focus
more on delivering value with our time rather than more routine tasks
