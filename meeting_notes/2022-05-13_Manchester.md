## Topics discussed

   - Review of standing items.
   - Updates from working groups.
   - We reviewed and discussed the Society's aims. We formulated the core purposes of
     the Society as being threefold. (1) Community building and RSE training - this encompasses
     bringing people together at conference, RSE Leaders Network events, Regional Groups and
     extending diversity and inclusion both from the EDIA side and the role diversity side
     (i.e. supporting embedded RSEs). (2) Championing RSE and outreach - this includes
     enabling RSEs to develop their skills and network and sharing resources (e.g. information
     on RSE group structures, case studies and more). (3) Professionalising RSE roles and
     supporting career progression through the RSE community.
   - We discussed our EDIA strategy. We will be releasing our strategy to the community,
     welcoming feedback and encouraging more members to join our team.
   - We reviewed the support we give to regional RSE groups.
   - Conference planning is a key task at the moment. Keynote speakers have been finalised.
     We made plans for a SocRSE stall.
   - We began a stakeholder analysis.
   - The trustee role was discussed, with a particular focus on how we can make the role
     more appealing to more members of the community and encourage greater diversity in
     these positions.
   - Formalised the steps that will be taken to bring the increased trustee term length to vote.
   - We discussed the possibility of including permanent staff in the management structure
     of the charity.
   - A freedom of information request procedures was progressed and GDPR was reviewed.
   - Actions were formalised for how we can ensure RSEs feel more welcome in the community and
     provide resources to our community that emphasise role diversity within RSE.
   - Discussed RSE awards to be presented to community members during the conference.
   - Agreed to open up the Society's process documents to community use.
   - We organised our support for RSE Midlands during their in-person meeting in Birmingham.
