## Topics discussed

   - Review of standing items.
   - Updates from working groups.
   - Approved the Society's safeguarding policy. Safeguarding is something that
     we have given greater thought to across all our functions - from Conference
     planning to looking after our volunteers. The Vice President is now responsible
     for ensuring the safeguarding policy is implemented.
   - Conference planning was discussed and trustees approved spending for an RSE Leaders'
     Dinner and an informal welcome event prior to the conference.
   - We brainstormed ways of restructuring our website so that it is easier for members
     of the community to know how they can get involved in the Society.
   - We discussed the REF consultation and the position that should be taken by the
     Society in relation to it. We realise that there will be a diversity of views within
     our community about the REF. We will draft responses to a subset of questions
     that are most relevant to the Society's goals and where the views of the Society
     are most unified.
   - We discussed award schemes for individuals in the community that we intend to present at the
     conference.
