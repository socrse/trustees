  - Registration now open
  - Streaming service will cost more than originally thought
    - Downstream effect is that modelling of outcomes of conference has more likelihood of making a loss

      (vote in decision summary)
- Finances
  - Have been able to make finances more understandable by report being generated on an accruals basis. 
    This means that the accounts will take into account the year of conference and community events rather than the exact financial year 
    that the money was transferred.
- Elections
  - Aiming to open nominations on the 26th of May and have an extra week for voting
- Leadership subgroup - following up with applications and working out roles
