## Topics discussed

   - Review of standing items.
   - Updates from working groups.
   - Discussion around remote attendance to RSECon22. As a Society we are always aiming
     to widen participation and make RSE events more accessible. However, a number of
     issues make it difficult for us to offer a hybrid conference and we will be releasing
     a statement about this very soon.
   - We are currently investigating the implications and challenges of offering all our
     members a Society email address. This could be offered as a membership benefit and a
     number of our partners have suggested a Society email address would allow them to
     offer benefits to our members more easily.
   - Progress was made on the Society awards that will be given out at RSECon22.
   - We decided on the prizes for the poster competition at RSECon22.
   - We progressed the planning around the trustee stall at RSECon22.
   - Plans were made for the forthcoming trustee elections.
