# Declarations of material rewards

This is a log in which any material rewards that trustees acquire either directly or
indirectly through their work as trustees are recorded. It does not, therefore,
capture all conflicts of interest that might arise, but rather those that incur
a material advantage. An example of material reward would be getting hospitality from a
conference venue while travelling with the aim of organising a society event.
