# SocRSE Decision Log

This is the log of formal decisions taken by the SocRSE Board of Trustees.

Decisions can be taken in a number of ways:

   -   Consensus: all present trustees agree
   -   Vote: present trustees voted
   -   Casting vote: chair used casting vote for decision
   -   Full vote: passed to all trustees for vote (including trustees not present at meeting)

If required for clarity, a reason for the decision will be added.
